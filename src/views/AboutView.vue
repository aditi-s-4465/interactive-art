    <h1>About SIGCHI</h1>
    <p> SIGCHI is a Special Interest Group within ACM (Association of Computing Machinery), which focuses on Computer-Human Interaction. In weekly meetings (Tuesdays at 6pm), we learn about real-world examples of computer-human interaction in current technology, and then engage in discussions and work on our main project for this year: a tool that produces sound/music from an art/picture, depending on where a person is looking at the artwork. <p>
    <br>

    <h1>Details About This Project </h1>
    <p> This project takes in human-interactive input via an eye tracker, uses the input to select an area of an image, and matches the average color of that area to a specific sound. To accomplish this, our SIG was divided into 4 sub-teams: one dedicated for the eye tracker functionality, one for the user interface, one for infra, and one for image-music conversion.</p>
